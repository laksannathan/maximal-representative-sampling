\section*{Abstract}

This is the template for a thesis at the Chair of Econometrics of
Humboldt--Universit\"at zu Berlin. A popular approach to write a
thesis or a paper is the IMRAD method (Introduction, Methods,
Results and Discussion). This approach is not mandatory! You can
find more information about formal requirements in the booklet
`Hinweise zur Gestaltung der \"au\ss eren Form von Diplomarbeiten'
which is available in the office of studies.\\

The abstract should not be longer than a paragraph of around 10 to
15 lines (or about 150 words). The abstract should contain a
concise description of the econometric/economic problem you
analyse and of your results. This allows the busy reader to obtain
quickly a clear idea of the thesis content.
