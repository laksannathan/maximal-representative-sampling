Imbalanced setting where the minority class GBS is the unlabeled class of interest but handled as negative. evaluation in the absence of actual negatives is further enhanced by class imbalance. puF-Measure instead of (or in addition to) puROC could reduce the effects of class imbalance. inclusion of f1-measure would be interesting. finally, the label "representative" is actually a property of a sample and not its single instances. survey mismatch from gbs to gesis renders most attributes useless regarding entropy. forces valu comparisons essentially introduce non existent pattern. one class classification suffers from high variance in estimating the fraction of actually representative gbs data. assessment of binary classifiers in pu settings does not lead to more accurate roc curve estimations as the fraction of positives cannot be estimated. overrepresentative underrep. rep and nonrep. trhoughout the thesis are not properly defined.
