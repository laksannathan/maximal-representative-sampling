\chapter{Results}\label{Sec:Results}

This chapter presents the results of the two positive-unlabeled learning approaches for maximal representative subsampling. Algorithm 1 has again been slightly modified, while the idea to improve the assessment of classifiers in a non-traditional setting was preserved. Discriminative algorithms includes logistic regression and support vector machines. The discussions begin with the difficulties of working and dealing with data from two different sources.

\section{Maximal Representative Subsample}

Since errors and inaccuracies slipped in quickly, preparing the data took a particularly long time. To ensure that the data has been read and mapped accordingly, various decision-trees have been trained right from the start to detect for mismatch.

\caption{Trees were trained using either sci-kit learn or WEKA explorer to identify preprocessing mistakes. The outer right path of the decision-tree demonstrates the desired behavior of the constructed model. "Resilienz"  and "Zufriedenheit Wahlergebnis" have been used to classify the majority of instances as GESIS. Both attributes have been measured on the same scale or mapped properly. Technically, this means that there was no better way to split the data at that specific node. Either the algorithm did not see any gain in continuing to split or the tree was further grown first and then pruned back using an out-of sample estimations.}

Figure 4.1 visualizes an exemplary J48 tree. For the reasons mentioned in Chapter 2, tree-based algorithms are particularly suitable for quickly capturing incorrectly handled data. A subgroup of all participants is said to be representative of the target population, regarding the particular complexity of the trained model. Model complexity, with respect to the right-most leaf node, gives high confidence to include the subgroup of 249 GBS instances in the MRS.

These trees, of course, only served as indicators during development. Th
The two-stage model is conceptually simpler than the integrated model, and may in some cases have the greatest practical utility. The main advantage compared to the integrated model is that regularization parameters can be tuned without prior knowledge by cross-validation. Another advantage of the two-stage model is that in the second stage, after the example-speciﬁc weights have been derived, virtually any learning mechanism can be employed to produce the ﬁnal classiﬁer from the weighted training sample. This comes at the cost of only a marginal loss of performance compared to the integrated model. The integrated and two-step logistic regression and exponential models and kernel mean matching perform similarly well.

In \cite{claesen2}, Claesen et al. emphasize the relative importance of known negatives compared to known positives. This was reason enough, to train a one-class classifier that estimates the GBS class prior with One-Class SVMs. That is, trying to estimate a function which is positive on GESIS and negative on the complement. The dataset that was used for training contains only all positve instances. In one-class SVM, the support vector model is trained on data that has only one class, which is GESIS. It infered the properties of representative cases and from these properties can predict which GBS participants are unlike the normal examples. Predictions from the One-Class SVM are uncalibrated scores that have not been normalized and therefore can not be compared to models based on different algorithms.

\section{Future Work}

Many diﬀerent adaptations, statistics, and experiments have been left for the future due to lack of time, i.e. data matching and transformation with real data have been very time consuming. Controlled environments are needed to observe the behavior of the proposed algorithm.

For one thing, future work concerns deeper analysis of the proposed sampling method, in particular, experiments on synthezised data. The Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE \cite{smote}) is a very popular oversampling method that creates synthetic minority class instances. The SMOTE instances are linear combinations of two similar instances from the minority class (\(x\) and \(x^{R}\)) and are defined as: \(s = x + u (x^{R} - x) \) with \(0 \geq  u \geq 1\). \(x^{R}\) is randomly chosen among the \(k\) nearest neighbors of \(x\) belonging to the minority class. SMOTE can be used to validate the MRS procedure by simulating the problem at hand.

Specific regions in the feature space are first over-sampled using SMOTE, before they are under-sampled by MRS. Experiments with multiple such synthesized data, with oversampling ratio ranging from high to low, might support the proposed procedure with greater evidence. The initial data sets are then compared to the result sets. GESIS is particularly well suited to artificially recreate the initial problem as visualized in Figure 5.1. It is only necessary to try to avoid giving the synthesized data properties that makes it possible for a learning algorithm to distinguish synthesized from non-synthesized example. This mechanism would for instance aid to compare classification results more easily.

The main criteria considered in this work has been the area under the ROC curve. Having a single-number evaluation metric speeds decision-making when selecting among non-representative instances. It gives a clear preference ranking among all of them, and therefore a clear direction for progress. To enable a basis for a more informed exclusion of instances, another important performance criterion generally used in information retrieval could be added. The F-Measure, including summary statistics derived from the precision-recall curve, may be preferred to ROC curves when classes are heavily skewed \cite{jesse}. Precision and recall have been estimated in section 3.3.1 in a positive-unlabeled setting. The area under precision-recall curves \(AUPR\) can be expressed using the approximated value for the fraction of positives \(\alpha\) in \(X_u\): \(\rho = \frac{\alpha \gamma}{\hat{\eta}^{pu}}\).
