MRS ALGORITHM:

Input:	
- NonRep N
- Rep R
- Temperature t
- n_drop //number of instances to drop per iteration
- limit // stopping criterion - samples left in N
- ensemble_size e
- model_complexity C
- bootstrap_size_factor k

Algorithm:

while N.size > limit (or AUC = 0.5):

    split data in k fold (stratified) in every iteration:

	    n = min(N.size, R.size)
	    N* = draw bootstraps of size n from a subset of N
            R* = draw bootstraps of size n from a subset of R

            classify all instances in remaining test set
    	    combine predictions (e predictions for each instance)

    remove correctly classified instances from N using softmax sampling(t)

return instances of N that are left (couldnt be distinguished from R)
