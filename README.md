## Discriminative Machine Learning for Maximal Representative Subsampling
This project deals with selection bias in social sciences. Discriminative learners are trained and combined to reduce the effect of bias in psychological and political studies. With positive-unlabeled learning and artificial data synthesis, performance estimation becomes more accurate in a non-traditional setting.

## Motivation
In scope of my bachelor thesis, the main goal is to apply machine learning to the fields of survey analytics.

## Installation
Python 3.6+ with Jupyter notebook and WEKA are necessary to get a development env running. If random_state is not provided, any init will come close to analysed results.
